        <p>The 10 km long Upper Canada Heritage Trail in Niagara-on-the-Lake is located on an abandoned railroad right
            of way that goes south from the Old Town beginning near King and John Streets and runs parallel to
            Concession 1 Road to end at York Road, between the villages of Queenston and St Davids. Here, the Trail
            continues as a sub-trail of the Bruce Trail. <br>
            The Heritage Trail encompasses a variety of landscapes from urban and Carolinian forest to rural orchards
            and vineyards. It lies entirely within Ontario’s Greenbelt. From East and West Line it passes through
            specialty crop areas before climbing through the Niagara Escarpment Region to York Road. It was formerly a
            side trail of the Bruce Trail. <br>

        <p>A total of 50 trees were planted on the Trail on October 13, 2021. Most of the trees were Chautauqua Oak
            trees that had been grown at Niagara College from acorns from the Chautauqua neighbourhood. The trees were
            provided by Canopy Growth Corporation and planted by students from Niagara College.

        <h3>The 4 Phases of the rehabilitation plan by the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, under the guidance of the Town's
            Heritage Trail Committee.</h3>
        <img src="Images/HeritageTrail - Phases update Sept 2021 - reduced.jpg" width="23%">
        <h4>After 2 years of fundraising and trail planning, the Heritage Trail Committee is very pleased to announce
            the rejuvenation of the whole of Phase One of the trail. 1500 metres have been resurfaced and completely
            rebuilt for multi-purpose use. Please come and see for yourself!</h4>
        <p>HERITAGE TRAIL REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROCEED IN 4 PHASES. THE THIRD PHASE IS FROM
            LINE 3 TO LINE 9. <br> THE LAST (4TH) PHASE IS FROM LINE 9 TO YORK ROAD. <br>
            The Heritage Trail Committee has installed 4 large signs on this section clearly outlining the full trail
            and its historic background. These attractive and dominant signs have been well placed to clearly mark the
            importance and history of the old rail line and trail. The Committee has enhanced the entrances of the trail
            at John Street, Paffard and Charlotte Streets with extra plantings and armour stone. <br>
            A fundraising effort was launched in 2019 which has successfully raised over $100,000 for the rehabilitation
            of the trail. Most of these donations have come from local residents and businesses who have purchased 1
            metre of trail for $100. More than 100 people and families have become “Trail Blazers”. As well there have
            been significant corporate donations - see below for details.</p>
        <h3>Improvements Needed for the Heritage Trail</h3>
        <p>The Heritage Trail is the only unimproved multi-use trail in the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake’s Official Plan.
            It dissects the epicentre of the Wine Route in NOTL, a key destination for cycling, eco-tourism and
            agri-tourism.<br>
            As the automobile was responsible for the decline of the railway, it seems fitting that a shift from the
            automobile to a renewed priority on active transportation has the potential to breathe new life back into
            the Heritage Trail.<br>
            The 66-foot-wide corridor is visibly broken and even unknown to many residents of Niagara-on-the-Lake.
            Utilization of the trail has been compromised in the last few years by erosion and washout between Line 9
            and York Road, and in other sections.<br>
            The overall integrity of the corridor is eroding due to an inability for people to use it. Vegetation and
            grass are growing where people used to walk, run, cycle and ride horses. The trail is losing its
            “visibility” in both a physical sense and in the overall consciousness of the Town of
            Niagara-on-the-Lake.<br>
            The NOTL Canada Sesquicentennial Committee, created in 2017 to support and execute events to commemorate
            Canada’s 150 years of Confederation, chose the rehabilitation of the Heritage Trail as its Legacy project,
            to connect communities and to preserve a piece of Canadian history for new generations.<br>
            A committee of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, The Heritage Trail, was initiated in 2019 and will be
            directed by a group of volunteers from the community.</p>
        <h3>Heritage Trail Committee Plans</h3>
